## 2. Target Market & Business Context

### Primary Market
Private schools in Algeria across all 58 wilayas. Algeria has over 3,000 private educational institutions, ranging from small single-level schools (primary only) to large multi-level institutions combining primary, middle, and high school under one roof.

### Key Insight: Schools Are Not All the Same
A critical design decision is that schools come in different configurations:

- **Single-level schools** — Primary only, Middle only, or High School only
- **Dual-level schools** — Primary + Middle, or Middle + High School
- **Full schools** — Primary + Middle + High School combined

The platform must handle all of these configurations cleanly, with each section (primary / middle / high school) managed independently within the same school tenant.

### Business Model
- **SaaS subscription** per school, billed monthly or annually
- Pricing tiered by number of active students
- Schools can optionally monetize premium content to their own students/parents through the platform (school earns revenue, platform takes a small fee)

### Revenue Projection Example

| Schools | Avg Monthly/School | Monthly Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 5 schools (pilot) | 0 DZD (free pilots) | Testimonials |
| 20 schools | 18,000 DZD | 360,000 DZD |
| 100 schools | 20,000 DZD | 2,000,000 DZD |
| 300 schools | 22,000 DZD | 6,600,000 DZD |

---

### 3.2 Academic Year Structure

All levels follow a **trimester system**:

```
September ──► October/November ──► January
     [Trimester 1]

February ──► March/April
     [Trimester 2]

April/May ──► June
     [Trimester 3]
```

Each trimester includes:
- Continuous Assessment (participation, quizzes, homework)
- First Test
- Second Test
- Final Examination

### 3.3 Grade Calculation Formula

```
Trimester Average = Σ(Subject Grade × Coefficient) ÷ Σ(Coefficients)

Yearly Average = (T1 Average + T2 Average + T3 Average) ÷ 3
```

**Default exam weighting within a trimester (configurable by school):**

| Component | Default Weight |
|---|---|
| Continuous Assessment | 20% |
| First Test | 20% |
| Second Test | 20% |
| Final Exam | 40% |

> ⚠️ **Design Note:** These weights MUST be configurable per school and per level from the admin panel. Some private schools use different weighting internally.

### 4.2 Multi-Tenant Strategy

Every school is a **tenant**. All data is isolated by tenant at the database query level. The Django backend extracts the school from the authenticated user's JWT token and automatically applies it as a filter to every query. No school can ever see another school's data.

```python
# Every ViewSet inherits this — no exceptions
class TenantAwareViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(school=self.request.user.school)
```

---

## 5. User Roles & Hierarchy

```
SUPER_ADMIN (Developer / You)
│   ├── Creates and manages all School tenants
│   ├── Manages billing and subscriptions
│   └── Can impersonate any school admin for support

SCHOOL_ADMIN (School Director / Secretary)
│   ├── Manages everything within their school
│   ├── Creates Teacher, Parent, and Student accounts
│   └── Multiple admin accounts allowed per school (different devices)

SECTION_ADMIN (Optional — for large combined schools)
│   ├── Admin limited to one section (e.g., Primary only)
│   └── Cannot see data from other sections of the same school

TEACHER
│   ├── Assigned to specific subjects and classes
│   ├── Can only see data for their assigned classes
│   └── Submits grades to admin for review and publication

PARENT
│   ├── Can have multiple children linked to their account
│   ├── Switches between children's profiles in the app
│   └── Receives data only about their own children

STUDENT
│   ├── Belongs to one class
│   ├── Age-adaptive interface based on school level
│   └── Can only see their own data
```

## 6. Authentication & Account Management

### 6.1 Core Principle

> **Nobody self-registers. Every account is created by a higher authority in the hierarchy.**

This guarantees identity integrity — the school already verified every student and parent identity physically during enrollment. We leverage that existing trust.

### 6.2 Account Creation Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You (Super Admin) creates School Admin accounts    │
│  → Delivers credentials via email or direct handoff │
└─────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                              │
┌─────────────────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│  School Admin creates Teacher accounts              │
│  → System generates temp password                   │
│  → Admin delivers via SMS or printed sheet          │
│  → Teacher forced to change password on first login │
└─────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                              │
┌─────────────────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│  School Admin creates Student + Parent accounts     │
│  → Admin fills form: student name, DOB, class,      │
│    parent phone number                              │
│  → System auto-creates linked Student + Parent      │
│    accounts simultaneously                          │
│  → Parent receives SMS with credentials             │
│  → Student receives printed card at school          │
│  → Both forced to change password on first login    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 6.3 One Parent → Multiple Children

When admin creates a second student with a phone number that already exists in the system:

```
Admin creates Student B with parent phone: 0555123456

System checks: Does phone 0555123456 already exist?
  YES → Link Student B to existing Parent account
        (no new account created, no duplicate)
  NO  → Create new Parent account, link to Student B
```

The parent sees a **child switcher** on the home screen of their app, similar to how Netflix lets you switch profiles. Each child's data is completely separate.

### 6.4 Bulk Import Flow

For onboarding a school with hundreds of students at year start:

1. Admin downloads the Excel template from the admin panel
2. Admin fills it with: student name, DOB, class, parent name, parent phone
3. Admin uploads the filled Excel file
4. Celery background task processes the file:
   - Creates student accounts
   - Creates or links parent accounts
   - Generates credentials
   - Queues SMS notifications to all parents
5. Admin sees a progress bar and a summary report when done (X accounts created, Y errors)

**Excel Template Columns:**
```
student_first_name | student_last_name | date_of_birth | 
class_name | section | parent_first_name | parent_last_name | 
parent_phone | parent_email (optional)
```

### 6.5 Authentication Method

- **JWT Authentication** with access token (15 min expiry) + refresh token (30 days)
- **Refresh token rotation** — each refresh issues a new refresh token and invalidates the old one
- **is_first_login flag** — redirects user to forced password change screen on first login
- **Biometric login** — after initial password setup, users can enable fingerprint/Face ID on mobile apps
- **PIN login** — for primary school students (ages 5–11) who struggle with passwords, a simple 4–6 digit PIN is supported as an alternative

### 6.6 User Base Model

```python
class User(AbstractBaseUser):
    # Identity
    id = UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)
    first_name = CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = CharField(max_length=100)
    phone_number = CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)
    email = EmailField(blank=True, null=True)
    photo = ImageField(upload_to='avatars/', null=True, blank=True)
    
    # Role & Tenant
    role = CharField(choices=ROLE_CHOICES)  # SUPER_ADMIN/ADMIN/TEACHER/PARENT/STUDENT
    school = ForeignKey('School', null=True, on_delete=CASCADE)
    section = ForeignKey('Section', null=True, blank=True)  # for Section Admin
    
    # Account State
    is_active = BooleanField(default=True)
    is_first_login = BooleanField(default=True)
    created_by = ForeignKey('self', null=True, on_delete=SET_NULL)
    created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    last_login = DateTimeField(null=True)
    
    USERNAME_FIELD = 'phone_number'
```

## 7. School Structure & Section Management

### 7.1 Flexible School Configuration

A school subscribes to ILMI and chooses which sections they operate. The platform fully supports:

| School Type | Sections Enabled |
|---|---|
| Primary school only | ✅ Primary |
| Middle school only | ✅ Middle |
| High school only | ✅ High School |
| Primary + Middle | ✅ Primary + ✅ Middle |
| Middle + High | ✅ Middle + ✅ High School |
| Full school | ✅ Primary + ✅ Middle + ✅ High School |

Each section is managed **independently** with its own:
- Classes and students
- Teachers and subject assignments
- Grading scale (Primary uses /10, Middle and High use /20)
- Academic year configuration (though usually shared)
- Streams (High School only)

### 7.2 Section Model

```python
class School(Model):
    id = UUIDField(primary_key=True)
    name = CharField(max_length=200)
    logo = ImageField()
    address = TextField()
    phone = CharField()
    email = EmailField()
    subscription_plan = CharField()
    subscription_active = BooleanField(default=True)
    subdomain = CharField(unique=True)  # e.g., "lycee-ibn-khaldoun"
    created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Section(Model):
    SECTION_TYPES = [
        ('PRIMARY', 'École Primaire'),
        ('MIDDLE', 'CEM'),
        ('HIGH', 'Lycée'),
    ]
    school = ForeignKey(School, on_delete=CASCADE)
    section_type = CharField(choices=SECTION_TYPES)
    name = CharField(max_length=100)  # e.g., "École Primaire Ibn Badis"
    director = ForeignKey(User, null=True)  # Section head if different from main admin
    is_active = BooleanField(default=True)
    
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ['school', 'section_type']
```

### 7.3 Class Structure

```python
class AcademicYear(Model):
    school = ForeignKey(School)
    section = ForeignKey(Section)
    name = CharField()  # "2025-2026"
    start_date = DateField()
    end_date = DateField()
    is_current = BooleanField(default=True)

class Class(Model):
    section = ForeignKey(Section)
    academic_year = ForeignKey(AcademicYear)
    name = CharField()         # "3AP-A", "1AM-B", "2AS-Sciences"
    level = CharField()        # "3AP", "1AM", "2AS" etc.
    stream = CharField(null=True, blank=True)  # "Sciences", "Math" etc. (High School only)
    homeroom_teacher = ForeignKey(User, null=True)
    max_students = IntegerField(default=35)
    
class StudentProfile(Model):
    user = OneToOneField(User)
    current_class = ForeignKey(Class)
    student_id = CharField()   # School's internal ID (e.g., "2025-0042")
    date_of_birth = DateField()
    enrollment_date = DateField()
    
class ParentProfile(Model):
    user = OneToOneField(User)
    children = ManyToManyField(StudentProfile, related_name='parents')
    # A parent can have multiple children; a student can also have multiple parents
    # (father and mother both with accounts)
    relationship = CharField()  # "Father", "Mother", "Guardian"

class TeacherProfile(Model):
    user = OneToOneField(User)
    section = ForeignKey(Section)
    specialization = CharField()  # Subject they are specialized in
```

## 8. Feature Specification — Admin Panel

The admin panel is a **web application** (React.js) accessible from any browser. It is the command center of the school. The UI must be designed for non-technical users — everything must be achievable through forms and buttons, no technical knowledge required.

### 8.1 Dashboard

- **Live statistics:** total students per section, active teachers, pending grade submissions, unread messages, upcoming events
- **Quick actions:** Post announcement, Add student, Generate report cards, View attendance alerts
- **Recent activity feed:** last 20 actions in the system with who did what and when
- **Academic calendar widget:** shows current trimester, days until next exam period, upcoming school events

### 8.2 School Configuration

- Edit school profile: name, logo, address, contacts, motto
- Activate/deactivate sections (Primary, Middle, High School)
- Configure academic year: start date, end date, trimester dates
- Set school-wide holidays and special events
- Configure grading weights per section (Continuous Assessment %, First Test %, etc.)
- Configure working days and school hours

### 8.3 User Management

#### Teachers
- Add teacher: name, phone, email, section, assigned subjects and classes
- Edit teacher profile and class assignments
- Deactivate/reactivate teacher account
- View teacher's submitted grades and activity log
- Bulk import teachers via Excel

#### Students & Parents
- Add student with automatic parent account creation
- Search students by name, class, section, or student ID
- View full student profile: personal info, current class, all grades history, attendance
- Transfer student to different class (with reason and date logged)
- Link additional parent to a student (some families have both parents registered)
- Deactivate student (end of year, transfer to another school)
- Bulk import students and parents via Excel

### 8.4 Class & Subject Management

- Create classes per section and academic year with a name and level
- Assign homeroom teacher to each class
- Define subjects per class with coefficients
- Assign a teacher to each subject within each class
- For High School: assign specialization streams to 2AS and 3AS classes

### 8.5 Grade Management

This is one of the highest-value features. The grade flow is:

```
Teacher enters grades (draft) 
    → Teacher submits to admin 
        → Admin reviews 
            → Admin publishes 
                → Visible to student and parent instantly
```

Admin functions:
- View all pending grade submissions from all teachers
- Filter by section, class, subject, trimester
- View the submitted marks with automatic average pre-calculation
- Add reviewer comments or correction notes before publishing
- Publish with one click (or reject and send back to teacher with note)
- View full grade history with audit trail (who entered, who published, timestamps)
- Bulk publish all grades for a trimester once all teachers have submitted

### 8.6 Report Card Generation

- Generate individual student report card as a formatted PDF
- Generate all report cards for an entire class in one operation (downloaded as ZIP)
- Generate all report cards for the entire school in one batch (ZIP, processed by Celery)

## 12. Grading System Design

### 12.1 Grade Model

```python
class Grade(Model):
    EXAM_TYPES = [
        ('CONTINUOUS', 'Continuous Assessment'),
        ('TEST_1', 'First Test'),
        ('TEST_2', 'Second Test'),
        ('FINAL', 'Final Exam'),
    ]
    STATUS = [
        ('DRAFT', 'Draft'),
        ('SUBMITTED', 'Submitted to Admin'),
        ('PUBLISHED', 'Published'),
        ('RETURNED', 'Returned for Correction'),
    ]
    
    student = ForeignKey(StudentProfile)
    subject = ForeignKey(Subject)
    trimester = IntegerField(choices=[1, 2, 3])
    academic_year = ForeignKey(AcademicYear)
    exam_type = CharField(choices=EXAM_TYPES)
    value = DecimalField(max_digits=4, decimal_places=2)  # e.g., 14.50
    max_value = DecimalField()  # 10 or 20 depending on section
    
    # Workflow
    status = CharField(choices=STATUS, default='DRAFT')
    submitted_by = ForeignKey(User)  # Teacher
    submitted_at = DateTimeField(null=True)
    reviewed_by = ForeignKey(User, null=True)  # Admin
    published_at = DateTimeField(null=True)
    admin_comment = TextField(blank=True)
    
class Subject(Model):
    section = ForeignKey(Section)
    class_obj = ForeignKey(Class)
    name = CharField()
    coefficient = DecimalField()
    teacher = ForeignKey(User)
    is_mandatory = BooleanField(default=True)

class TrimesterConfig(Model):
    """Configurable grade weights per school per section"""
    school = ForeignKey(School)
    section = ForeignKey(Section)
    continuous_weight = DecimalField(default=0.20)  # 20%
    test1_weight = DecimalField(default=0.20)
    test2_weight = DecimalField(default=0.20)
    final_weight = DecimalField(default=0.40)
```

### 12.2 Automatic Calculations

All averages are calculated server-side by the Django backend, never on the client:

```python
def calculate_subject_trimester_average(student, subject, trimester):
    config = TrimesterConfig.objects.get(school=student.school, section=student.section)
    grades = Grade.objects.filter(
        student=student, subject=subject, 
        trimester=trimester, status='PUBLISHED'
    )
    
    weights = {
        'CONTINUOUS': config.continuous_weight,
        'TEST_1': config.test1_weight,
        'TEST_2': config.test2_weight,
        'FINAL': config.final_weight,
    }
    
    weighted_sum = sum(g.value * weights[g.exam_type] for g in grades)
    total_weight = sum(weights[g.exam_type] for g in grades)
    return weighted_sum / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else None

def calculate_trimester_overall_average(student, trimester):
    subjects = Subject.objects.filter(class_obj=student.current_class)
    numerator = sum(
        calculate_subject_trimester_average(student, s, trimester) * s.coefficient
        for s in subjects
    )
    denominator = sum(s.coefficient for s in subjects)
    return numerator / denominator if denominator > 0 else None
```

## 13. Messaging & Communication System

### 13.1 Chat Room Types

| Room Type | Participants | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TEACHER_PARENT` | 1 teacher + 1-2 parents of a specific student | Formal private communication about that student |
| `TEACHER_STUDENT` | 1 teacher + 1 student | Course questions and answers |
| `CLASS_BROADCAST` | Teacher → all students in a class | Announcements to the whole class |
| `ADMIN_PARENT` | Admin + specific parent | Administrative communication |
| `ADMIN_BROADCAST` | Admin → all users / specific group | School-wide announcements |

### 13.2 Real-Time Architecture

```
Client (Flutter/React) 
    → WebSocket connection (Django Channels)
        → Channel Layer (Redis)
            → Message stored in PostgreSQL
                → Push notification via FCM (if recipient offline)
```

```python
class ChatRoom(Model):
    ROOM_TYPES = ['TEACHER_PARENT', 'TEACHER_STUDENT', 'CLASS_BROADCAST', 'ADMIN_PARENT', 'ADMIN_BROADCAST']
    room_type = CharField(choices=ROOM_TYPES)
    school = ForeignKey(School)
    related_student = ForeignKey(StudentProfile, null=True)  # for teacher-parent rooms
    related_class = ForeignKey(Class, null=True)  # for broadcast rooms
    participants = ManyToManyField(User)
    created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Message(Model):
    room = ForeignKey(ChatRoom)
    sender = ForeignKey(User)
    content = TextField(blank=True)
    attachment = FileField(null=True, blank=True)
    attachment_type = CharField(null=True)  # 'image', 'pdf', 'document'
    sent_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    read_by = ManyToManyField(User, through='MessageRead')

class MessageRead(Model):
    message = ForeignKey(Message)
    user = ForeignKey(User)
    read_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### 13.3 Message Templates (Teacher Pre-written)

Stored per school, configurable from admin panel:

```python
class MessageTemplate(Model):
    school = ForeignKey(School)
    title = CharField()   # "Academic Concern"
    body = TextField()    # "I would like to discuss [student_name]'s performance in [subject]..."
    category = CharField()  # 'concern', 'positive', 'absence', 'general'
    language = CharField()  # 'ar', 'fr', 'en'
```

```

### 14.2 Knowledge Base (Per School Tenant)

Static knowledge — managed by admin through admin panel:

- School name, address, contacts, opening hours
- Academic calendar: semester dates, exam periods, holidays
- Teacher directory: names, subjects, contact information
- School rules and regulations
- Frequently Asked Questions (admin writes these manually)
- Fee structure and payment information

Dynamic knowledge — queried live from database:
- Student's marks (filtered to authenticated user's child)
- Homework and assignments
- Attendance records
- Upcoming events from school calendar

### 14.3 Embedding & Indexing Pipeline

```
Admin uploads/edits school knowledge document
        │
        ▼
Django signals Celery task
        │
        ▼
Celery task: chunk text → generate embeddings (sentence-transformers multilingual model)
        │
        ▼
Store vectors in Qdrant (namespace = school_id for tenant isolation)
        │
        ▼
Knowledge base updated — chatbot now has the new information
```

### 14.4 Multilingual Support

The system supports Arabic, French, and English natively. The LLM responds in whatever language the user writes in. The multilingual sentence transformer model (`paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`) handles Arabic, French, and English embeddings in the same vector space.

### 14.5 Safety & Scope Guardrails

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are the school assistant for {school_name}. 
You help parents and students with questions about school life and academics.

Rules:
1. Only answer questions about {school_name} and the specific student you are helping.
2. Never reveal information about other students.
3. Never modify any data — you are read-only.
4. If you don't know the answer, say: "Please contact the school administration."
5. Always respond in the same language the user writes in.
6. Be respectful, warm, and professional.

Context about this school:
{retrieved_context}

Context about this student/parent:
{student_data}
"""
```

    valid_until = DateField()
    created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

## 16. Database Schema & Models

### 16.1 Complete Model Map

```
School (tenant root)
├── Section (PRIMARY / MIDDLE / HIGH)
│   ├── AcademicYear
│   ├── Class → Subject → Grade
│   │              └── TeacherProfile

```

### 16.2 Key Design Decisions

- **UUIDs as primary keys** everywhere — prevents enumeration attacks and is better for distributed systems
- **Soft deletes** on all critical models (students, teachers, grades) — add `is_deleted` and `deleted_at` fields, never actually delete
- **Audit trail** — `created_by`, `created_at`, `updated_by`, `updated_at` on all models
- **Section isolation** — queries always scoped first to school, then to section
- **Immutable grade history** — once a grade is published, it can only be amended with a new record, never overwritten

## 19. Security & Data Protection

### 19.1 Authentication Security

- JWT access tokens: 15-minute expiry
- Refresh tokens: 30-day expiry with rotation (each use invalidates old token)
- HTTPS enforced — HTTP redirected to HTTPS in Nginx
- Rate limiting: max 5 failed logins → 30 minute lockout
- Passwords hashed with **argon2** (Django default pbkdf2 is weaker)
- Session revocation: admin can invalidate all tokens of any user from admin panel

### 19.2 Data Isolation

- Every database query filtered by `school` extracted from JWT — server-side, never client-side
- Section-level isolation: teachers and section admins cannot see other sections' data
- Students cannot query other students' data — enforced at view level
- Parents can only see data about their own linked children

### 19.3 File Security

- All uploaded files stored in private S3 buckets (not publicly accessible URLs)
- Files served via signed URLs with 1-hour expiry
- File type validation on upload (MIME type + extension check)
- Maximum file size enforced: 20MB per file

### 19.4 API Security

- CORS: only allow requests from registered app origins and admin panel domain
- All sensitive endpoints require authentication
- Input validation and sanitization on all POST/PATCH endpoints
- SQL injection: impossible with Django ORM (no raw SQL queries)
- XSS: React and Flutter both escape content by default

### 19.5 Infrastructure Security

- Database port (5432) NOT exposed to internet — internal Docker network only
- Redis port NOT exposed to internet
- All secrets in environment variables — never in codebase
- Daily automated database backups retained for 30 days
- Dependency vulnerability scanning in GitHub Actions CI pipeline

## 20. Multi-Tenancy Design

### 20.1 Tenant Isolation Strategy

Every model that belongs to a school has a direct `school` foreign key. All ViewSets inherit from a base class that automatically applies tenant filtering:

```python
class TenantAwareViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """All school-scoped ViewSets must inherit this."""
    
    def get_queryset(self):
        qs = super().get_queryset()
        if self.request.user.role == 'SUPER_ADMIN':
            return qs  # Super admin sees all
        return qs.filter(school=self.request.user.school)
    
    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        serializer.save(school=self.request.user.school)
```

### 20.2 Qdrant Namespace Isolation (Chatbot)

Each school has its own namespace in Qdrant for vector isolation:

```python
collection_name = f"school_{school.id}_knowledge"
```

A school's chatbot can never retrieve vectors from another school.

### 20.3 Super Admin Capabilities

The super admin panel allows:
- View all schools and their subscription status
- Activate / deactivate any school
- Create new school tenant with initial admin account
- Impersonate any school admin for support (with full audit log)
- View platform-wide usage statistics
- Manage subscription plans and pricing

## 21. Notifications System

### 21.1 Notification Types

| Event | Who Gets Notified | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| Grade published | Student + Parent | Push + In-app |
| New homework posted | Students in class | Push + In-app |
| Student marked absent | Parent | Push + In-app + SMS |
| New announcement | Target audience | Push + In-app |
| New message received | Recipient | Push + In-app |
| Report card available | Parent | Push + In-app |
| Payment reminder | Parent | Push + In-app |
| New premium content | Students in class | Push + In-app |
| School event tomorrow | All users | Push + In-app |
| Grade submitted (by teacher) | Admin | In-app only |

### 21.2 Notification Model

```python
class Notification(Model):
    TYPES = ['GRADE', 'HOMEWORK', 'ATTENDANCE', 'ANNOUNCEMENT', 
             'MESSAGE', 'REPORT_CARD', 'PAYMENT', 'EVENT']
    
    user = ForeignKey(User)
    school = ForeignKey(School)
    title = CharField()
    body = TextField()
    notification_type = CharField(choices=TYPES)
    related_object_id = UUIDField(null=True)  # ID of the grade/homework/etc.
    related_object_type = CharField(null=True)  # 'Grade', 'HomeworkPost', etc.
    is_read = BooleanField(default=False)
    read_at = DateTimeField(null=True)
    created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### 21.3 Delivery Flow

```
Event occurs in Django (e.g., admin publishes grades)
        │
        ▼
Django signal fires → Celery task queued
        │
        ▼
Celery task:
    1. Create Notification record in DB (in-app)
    2. Send FCM push notification to user's device tokens
    3. Send SMS if event is high-priority (absent student)
```
